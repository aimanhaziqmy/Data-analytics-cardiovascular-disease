# Data Analytics: Cardiovascular Disease Risk

## Introduction
This project analyzes a dataset related to cardiovascular disease. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains valuable information for understanding and predicting cardiovascular disease risk factors.

**Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/)

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
In this section, we will discuss the process of data cleaning and analysis performed on the dataset.

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. It involves handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and making the data suitable for statistical analysis.

#### Missing Values
We began by identifying and addressing missing values in the dataset. Various techniques such as imputation or removal of rows/columns were applied based on the nature of the missing data.

#### Outliers
Outliers can significantly affect the results of our analysis. We employed statistical methods to detect and handle outliers appropriately.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns or relationships between variables.

#### Data Visualization
We created various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and box plots, to better understand the distribution of variables and their correlations.

#### Summary Statistics
We computed summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation to describe the central tendencies and variability of key features.

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involves creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve the performance of predictive models.

### Data Analysis
With a clean dataset and engineered features, we conducted an in-depth analysis of cardiovascular disease risk factors. This analysis included:

- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
- Statistical tests to assess the significance of different features.
- Machine learning models for prediction and classification tasks.

## Results
In this section, we present the key findings and results obtained from our data analysis. This may include insights into risk factors, predictive models, and recommendations for further research or interventions.

## Conclusion
We conclude the data analytics project by summarizing the main outcomes and their implications for understanding and predicting cardiovascular disease. Additionally, we may suggest potential actions or interventions based on our findings.
